# matrix-java
A java class library designed to be used for matrix operations

It's designed as OOP as I could make it.  Ideally, it should just be jar the files and use it.  

As of today, 9-Mar-2015, it has Matrix, SquareMatrix, and LUPDecomposition classes.  

The next planned expansion is QR decomposition for the purposes of calculating eigenvalues.

Next time I get asked about matrix multiplication during an interview, I'll be ready.
